## Academic Interests
I am passionate about the intersection of robotics and biomedical imaging, with a particular focus on developing devices that can aid in the early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease. My goal is to design robotic systems and imaging tools that improve precision, enhance diagnostic capabilities, and support minimally invasive procedures, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. This work combines my interests in electrical engineering, control systems, and sensor technology with meaningful healthcare applications. I plan to continue exploring this field in graduate school, pursuing a degree in Biomedical Engineering to further advance my ability to develop innovative solutions for neurological diseases.

## Personal Interests
My interests include going to the gym and really anything active. I used to play soccer, tennis, basketball, and golf and still play recreationally. On the flip side, I love to watch sports, too, especially football. I am a huge Ravens fan. My family are also big into National Parks. I have actually collected Junior Ranger Badges from over 50 National Parks around the US. On more chill Sunday nights, I like to play the guitar, read science fiction, and watch movies (if you ever need a recommendation I got you).
