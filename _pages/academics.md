## Engineering Inspiration
Growing up, my parents instilled in me a love for physics and math. Annual trips to the Air and Space Museum weren’t just outings, seeing the Apollo 11 command module while my dad explained the details of the moon landing sparked a curiosity that never left me. At home, dinner conversations often turned into questions like why don’t birds get electrocuted on power lines? My father and I spent hours tinkering with Raspberry Pis, programming lights, and 3D-printing parts for home repairs. These experiences gave me my first taste of engineering, and I was hooked.

In high school, I expanded this passion through robotics, programming competitions, math contests, and IT internships. But it was a deeply personal experience, watching my grandfather battle dementia, that gave my interests purpose. I want to use robotics and electronics to create more reliable, accessible medical devices, particularly in early Alzheimer’s detection. For me, engineering is not only about solving problems, but also about helping others.
